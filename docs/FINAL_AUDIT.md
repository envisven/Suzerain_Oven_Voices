# Final completion audit

Authoritative project: `/Users/nistaltothantal/Documents/Codex/2026-09-17/all/work/run1/SordlandTreeViewer`.

Continued the current implementation; did not restore an older ZIP or rewrite the overhaul. Reviewed the complete Run 1 (A–Q), Run 2 (A–S), final completion card (0–16) and zero-assumption audit (17 A–F). A pre-edit source/test/docs snapshot is preserved in the workspace audit directory. No reference-screenshot archive was supplied with these inputs; theme acceptance is based on the specified dark/contrast/semantic criteria and actual rendered output.

## Requirement matrix

PASS means code inspected plus the named behavior checked. Initial UNVERIFIED denotes requirements whose runtime/behavioral evidence had not yet been established in this completion pass. No row is passed merely because a class compiled. Repeated requirements across the cards are consolidated below with their complete behavioral subcriteria.

Evidence: **T** = complete principal test suite; **G** = successful JavaFX smoke with reviewed actual rendered PNGs; **S** = independent source inventory/control-flow inspection; **D** = final document/source discrepancy review.

## Final test inventory

Every `tests/sordland/*Checks.java` is called by `AllTests.java`: ActorFilterChecks, CampaignLayoutChecks, DataChecks, DialogueChecks, EdgeChecks, GameFlowLoaderChecks, JsonChecks, LayoutChecks, LoaderChecks, NewsChecks, RootedCampaignChecks, SemanticChecks, SourceAccountingChecks, SourceClassificationChecks, TextChecks, ThemeTypographyChecks, TypeProjectionChecks and ViewportChecks. DialogueChecks/SourceClassificationChecks/TypeProjectionChecks also run their real-data entry points. No Checks file is accidentally unused. TestSupport is assertion infrastructure, not a missing suite.

## Remaining source constraints

- Actor-name list positions do not prove dialogue ActorIDs. The 103 source names remain visible in Ignored Data; source dialogue labels provide speaker names.
- No game-state interpreter is supplied. Conditional/optional effects describe source possibilities, not feasible playthrough outcomes. GameFlow normally establishes progression, not unique event causality.
- Unproven News stays accessible in PLAIN. Unknown turn-condition false destinations stay unresolved. Neither is filled with guessed topology.
- No reference screenshot archive was supplied; no visual-copy claim is made.

No known requested implementation omission remains. Graphical verification uses the existing smoke automation on a real Mac JavaFX display, not an assertion of exhaustive manual clicking of every source entry. The native UI connector could not bind to the unbundled Java executable, so reviewed JavaFX scene snapshots and the smoke handlers supplied the GUI evidence. This did not prevent successful GUI verification.

## Exact files, defects and commands

[CHANGED_FILES.md](CHANGED_FILES.md) lists every changed source/test/document file for this completion pass and for the complete overhaul versus the supplied ZIP. [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md) maps discovered defects to fixes. [VALIDATION.md](VALIDATION.md) records commands, counts, build/runtime results and evidence.
